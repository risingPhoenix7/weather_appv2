**What does the app do?**

It asks for your location, if you accept then it will show all the necessary weather data for the current, 8th hour from now and fifteenth hour
If you deny location access, it will show bangalore's weather (bcz bengaluru's climate is the best and let everyone know it's weather)
Also there's a search button in a corner on pressed will navigate to a page containing a searchbar.
On searching for the location, it will either show an error message or go back to the main page and update the data

**What are it's features?**

Implements MVVM architecture
Uses openweather api calling

**Shortcomings** (if not already fixed by now)

Almost all the UI is fitted in one page, a bad practice, will fix another day.

**Comments**

I can say this for sure, using http+copy pasting data class is much better than retrofit..
